### Angular Proof Of Concept

This repo contains several small projects, created using Angular current version (depending on when they were created), testing different Angular features, concepts or packages.

The main goal is to practice and create code snippets to keep handy.

The projects contained includes: 
- An Angular architecture example
- A small example project using Ngrx for state management.
- An example project that uses Ngxs as a state manager.
